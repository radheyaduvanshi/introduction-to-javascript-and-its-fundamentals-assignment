In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data in your programs. They allow you to store values and manipulate them throughout the execution of your code. 
The let keyword is one of the ways to declare variables in JavaScript. Here's how you can use it:

let number = 42; 
let message = "Hello, World!"; 
let isTrue = true; 
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']; 
let person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30
};
