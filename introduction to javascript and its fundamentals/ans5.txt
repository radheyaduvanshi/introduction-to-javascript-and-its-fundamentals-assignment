Comments in JavaScript are essential for documenting code, enhancing code readability, and facilitating collaboration among developers. They are non-executable text 
that is ignored by the JavaScript interpreter, serving as notes or explanations within the code.

Here's why comments are important:

Documentation: Comments provide information about the purpose and functionality of code. They help developers, including the original author, understand the logic
               and intention behind specific code sections.

Readability: Well-commented code is easier to read and maintain. It aids developers in quickly grasping the structure and functionality of a script or function, 
             especially when revisiting the code after some time.

Collaboration: Comments make it easier for multiple developers to work on the same codebase. By explaining complex algorithms, design decisions, or potential pitfalls, 
               comments contribute to effective collaboration.

single-line and multi-line comments in JavaScript:

Single-line comments:
// This is a single-line comment
let variable = 42; // we can also add a comment at the end of a line of code
In the above example, // is used to indicate a single-line comment. Everything to the right of // on that line is treated as a comment and is ignored by the JavaScript interpreter.

Multi-line comments:
/*
  This is a multi-line comment
  It can span multiple lines
  Useful for providing detailed explanations or commenting out blocks of code
*/
let result = 3 * 7;
Here, /* starts the multi-line comment, and */ ends it. Everything between these markers is considered a comment.
