In JavaScript, primitive data types are basic data types that are not objects and do not have methods. Here are the five primitive data types in JavaScript:

String:A sequence of characters.
       Enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or backticks ( ) quotes.
       Example: "Hello, World!"

Number:Represents numeric values.
       Can be integers or floating-point numbers.
       Example: 42 or 3.14

Boolean:Represents a logical value indicating true or false.
        Used in conditional expressions and control flow.
        Example: true or false

Undefined:Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
          If a variable is declared but not initialized, it has the value undefined.
          Example: let x; (here, x is undefined until assigned a value)

Null:Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
     It is a special value that signifies no value or no object as a result of a deliberate assignment.
     Example: let y = null;
